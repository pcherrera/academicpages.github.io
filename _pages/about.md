I am Pablo Herrera Ph.D student at Pontificia Universidad Católica 
under the supervision of [Norbert Heuer](http://www.mat.uc.cl/~nheuer/) and 
[Thomas Führer](http://www.mat.uc.cl/~tofuhrer/). My research focus is the numerical
resolution of Higher order Partial Differential Equations and Discontinous Petrov Galerkin methods.
