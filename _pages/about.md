Welcome to my academic website. 

My name is Pablo Herrera Ph.D in Mathematics at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. 
and I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaiso. My work focuses on Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) Methods with optimal test functions, Higher-Order PDEs, and neural control.
