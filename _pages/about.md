Welcome to my academic website. 

My name is Pablo Herrera Ph.D in Mathematics at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile 
and I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaiso. My work focuses on Numerical analysis for PDE, Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) Methods with optimal test functions, neural control and quad-div and quad-curl problems.
